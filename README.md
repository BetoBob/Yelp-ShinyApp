# Yelp-ShinyApp

## Description
Using Leaflet and the open yelp dataset, we plan to geographically analyze yelp businesses and reviews in San Luis Obispo. We will generate a heat map of locations in SLO that are in close proximity to highly rated yelp businesses. The user will be able to set parameters such as business category, price range, hours open, etc.
